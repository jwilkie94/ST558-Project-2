# Repo Description

We created a repo for project 2. In this repo,  two group members can pull the request, do the work individually, and push to the main branch. This repo was designed to perform analyses of different types on articles from an online news source.  We generated four linear and ensemble models for comparison.  The data was split into a training and test set.  Each model was trained against the training set using cross validation.  The test data set was used for prediciton and the most accurate model was chosen based on the lowest RMSE value.
